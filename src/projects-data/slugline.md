This is an (in-progress) **React + Django** CMS for mathNEWS, a campus publication I contribute to and edit.

Our old WordPress limited us to only being able to provide full PDFs of issues, and the WordPress editor did not support all the content that we can render in InDesign.

Highlights include:

- a brand-new rich text editor that supports everything we publish
- the ability to link to individual articles, increasing user engagement
- an export pipeline that saves editors hours of time of InDesign formatting
