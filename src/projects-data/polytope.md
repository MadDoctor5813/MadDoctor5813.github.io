Like a lot of kids growing up, I wanted to make video games. I figured out pretty quick
that making games is more than just programming, but the love for doing low-level graphics
code stuck with me.

This project is a learning project for various graphics techniques, and other game engine techniques.

Currently it supports:

- a resource system that compiles meshes and textures to objects ready to use in the engine
- a material system
- colored directional lighting and shadow mapping
