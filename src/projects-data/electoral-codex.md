This project, a polling station level map of Canadian election results, was an opportunity for me to combine my interests in politics and data visualization.

Highlights include:

- a clean, preprocessed database of Canadian election results from 2004-2015, and a **Python** script to generate that data
- an interactive, polling station level map of those results, built with MapBox
- cool animated charts with **D3**
